# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in Radius!

This project has adopted the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://github.com/project-radius/radius/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

Contributions come in many forms: submitting issues, writing code, participating in discussions and community calls.

This document provides the guidelines for how to contribute to the Radius project.

## Issues

This section describes the guidelines for submitting issues

### Issue Types

There are 4 types of issues:

- bug: You've found a bug with the code and want to report it or create an issue to track the bug.
- discussion: You have something on your mind, which requires input form others in a discussion, before it eventually manifests as a proposal.
- proposal: Used for items that propose a new idea or functionality. This allows feedback from others before code is written.
- question: Use this issue type if you need help or have a question.

### Before You File

Before you file an issue, make sure you've checked the following:

1. Is it the right repository?
    - The Radius project is distributed across multiple repositories. Check the list of [repositories](https://github.com/project-radius) if you aren't sure which repo is the correct one.
1. Check for existing issues
    - Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/project-radius/recipes/issues) to see if the issue or feature request has already been filed.
    - If you find your issue already exists, make relevant comments and add your [reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reaction-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction:
        - üëç up-vote
        - üëé down-vote
1. For bugs
    - Check it's not an environment issue. For example, if running on Kubernetes, make sure prerequisites are in place.
    - Ensure you have as much data as possible. This usually comes in the form of logs and/or stacktrace. If running on Kubernetes or other environment, look at the logs of the Radius services (UCP, RP, DE). More details on how to get logs can be found [here](https://docs.radapp.dev/reference/troubleshooting-radius/).
1. For proposals
    - Many changes to the Radius runtime may require changes to the API. In that case, the best place to discuss the potential feature is the main [Radius repo](https://github.com/project-radius/radius).
    - Recipes runtime changes can be discussed in the [Radius repo](https://github.com/project-radius/radius).
    - Community Recipes can be discussed here.

## Contributing to Radius Recipes

This section describes the guidelines for contributing code / docs to Radius Recipes.

### Pull Requests

All contributions come through pull requests. To submit a proposed change, we recommend following this workflow:

1. Make sure there's an issue (bug or proposal) raised, which sets the expectations for the contribution you are about to make.
1. Fork the relevant repo and create a new branch
1. Create your change
    - Code changes require tests
1. Update relevant documentation for the change
1. Commit and open a PR
1. Wait for the CI process to finish and make sure all checks are green
1. A maintainer of the repo will be assigned, and you can expect a review within a few days

#### Use work-in-progress PRs for early feedback

A good way to communicate before investing too much time is to create a draft PR and share it with your reviewers. The standard way of doing this is to mark your PR as draft within GitHub.

**Thank You!** - Your contributions to open source, large or small, make projects like this possible. Thank you for taking the time to contribute.
