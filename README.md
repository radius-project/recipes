# Radius Community Recipes

This repository contains commonly used [Recipe](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/overview/) templates for Radius Environments.

## Recipes

Recipes provide self-service infrastructure provisioning for developers. Developers select the resource(s) they need, and operators can configure Recipes with secure, approved, infrastructure. For more information about the supported resource types and the IaC languages, please refer to the [Recipes overview](https://docs.radapp.io/guides/recipes/overview/) page.

## Repository Structure

Recipes in this repository are organized by the environments and the resource types they support. Below is the structure:

        - <environment> eg : aws
          - <resourcetype.bicep> eg : rediscaches.bicep
          - <resourcetype> eg : rediscaches
             - <main.tf>
             - <variables.tf>

All the available Recipes can be found in the folders below:

  - [Local Dev](/local-dev) 
  - [Azure](/azure)
  - [AWS](/aws) 

## Versioning and Tags

Recipes are versioned using [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Each Recipe is tagged with its version number, and the `latest` tag points to the latest version of each Recipe. For example, Radius v0.21 uses the `0.21` tag for each Recipe:

```
ghcr.io/radius-project/recipes/azure/rediscaches:0.21
```

### Patching

Patched versions of Recipes are tagged with the patch number, e.g. `0.21.1`. When the tag is created for a patch, the patch and minor tags are updated to point to the new patch version. For example, if `0.21.1` is released, the `0.21` and `0.21.1` tags will be pushed. Consumers of `0.21` will automatically receive the patch update. It is recommended to use the minor tag when consuming Recipes, e.g. `0.21`.

## Usage

To use a community recipe from this repo, simply use [`rad recipe register`](https://docs.radapp.io/reference/cli/rad_recipe_register) with the Recipe's template path, or update your environment's Bicep definition with the Recipe:

### CLI

```bash
rad recipe register azure \
  --environment myenv \
  --template-kind bicep \ 
  --template-path "ghcr.io/radius-project/recipes/azure/rediscaches:TAG" \
  --resource-type "Applications.Datastores/redisCaches"
```

### Bicep

```bicep
extension radius 

resource myenv 'Applications.Core/environments' = {
  name: 'myenv'
  properties: {
    compute: {...}
    recipes: {
      'Applications.Core/redisCaches': {
        'azure': {
          template-kind: 'bicep'
          template-path: 'ghcr.io/radius-project/recipes/azure/rediscaches:0.21'
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
